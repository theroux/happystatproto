				<h2 class="question">Why do you care about this data?</h2>
				<p class="answer short">Open. Live. Mobile. Culture. Code.</p>
				<p class="answer">These are words that you regularly hear from our leadership teams, and we believe that we should hear from you as well! HappyStat is all of these things - it allows you to tell us how you're feeling "right now" so that we can better understand the sentiment across the organization at any given time. The company-wide results will be visible to everyone, and we'll integrate analysis of HappyStat trends into regular reporting and decision-making that happens across the leadership and management teams.</p>
